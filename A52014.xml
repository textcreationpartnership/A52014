            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>THis following Discourse doth chiefly tend to disswade from Division, and perswade to Peace and Æ²nity; shewing the danger of the one, and the excellency and necessity of the other: a Subject, which I thought most necessary for that occasion upon which it was preached; The unanimous consent of the Citizens, in the Election of your Lordship to be Mayor for the succeeding Year, gives me some ground
<pb facs="tcp:93582:3"/>of hopes, that what was said was not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together unuseful. I need not mind your Lordship (who is so well known to be a Lover of Æ²nity) that it is your Part, in that station, wherein God hath placed you, to uphold, and promote this good A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement, what in you lies, in that great Body over which you are placed, as it seems, by the special Providence of God, for this very end and purpose. What was upon that great Solemnity preached, is now, by the Command of your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and the Honourable Court of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermen, made publick. And that it may have some influence upon us, to breed in us a general abhorrence of Division and Dissention, and provoke all Protestants to a serious study of, and endeavour after a happy Æ²nion both in Church and State, is the earnest Prayer of,</p>

               <bibl>
                  <hi>LUKE xi. 17.</hi>
               </bibl>
               <p>But he knowing their thoughts said unto them, Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry kingdom divided against it self is brought to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation, and an house divided against an house, falleth.</p>
            </q>
            <p>IN the Verses aforegoing, you have an account of a <hi>Devil,</hi> which is said to be <hi>dumb;</hi> that is, he made the person <hi>dumb,</hi> whom he had possessed.</p>
            <p>St. <hi>Matthew</hi> saith, that this <hi>Devil</hi> was <hi>blind,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 12.22.</note> as well as <hi>dumb, viz.</hi> because he made the party, by him possessed, so.</p>
            <p>St. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> adds, that he was a <hi>deaf Devil</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:93582:4"/>too; which is not improbable, since <hi>Deafness</hi> is the natural cause of <hi>Dumbness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Man, thus miserably afflicted, and possessed with such a <hi>dumb, blind,</hi> and <hi>deaf Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> was brought unto our Lord, (who was sent, by his Father, into the World, on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to destroy the works of the <hi>Devil</hi>) that he might be freed from this so foul a Fiend; who pitying his condition, freed him from this troublesome Guest: so that the <hi>Dumb</hi> did speak, the <hi>Blind</hi> saw, the <hi>Deaf</hi> did hear.</p>
            <p>This notable Miracle, wrought by our Lord, produced several effects in the people.</p>
            <p>Some of the common sort of people <hi>won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd,</hi> (saith St. <hi>Luke</hi>) they were amazed at it,<note place="margin">Luke 11. v. 14. Matth. 12.23.</note> (saith St. <hi>Matthew</hi>) they were in an ecstasie, as well they might: for this must needs be a just cause of astonishment, to see the <hi>Devils</hi> thus com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, which no humane power could effect.</p>
            <p>Another sort there were, of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees,</hi> who sought to eclipse the glory of this famous Miracle, wrought by our Lord. These seemed to grant,<note place="margin">v. 16.</note> that <hi>Christ</hi> indeed did many Miracles, but they would see a Sign from Heaven, such, it may be, as the <hi>Prophet</hi> shewed, when he fetch'd <hi>Fire</hi> from Heaven; or <hi>Joshua,</hi> at whose word, the <hi>Sun</hi> stood still;
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:93582:4"/>or <hi>Moses,</hi> who fetched down <hi>Manna</hi> from Heaven, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That they should desire a Sign, was not unreasonable, since the Law was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven with Signs; and therefore it was conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent there should be as full an Evidence given them, that the fulness of time was come, when that dispensation was to have an end: but that they should stand so much upon a Sign from Heaven, was very importune and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent.<note place="margin">More rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of this may be seen in Dr. <hi>Stillingfl. Orig. Sac. lib.</hi> 2 <hi>c.</hi> 9.</note> And therefore no wonder that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour doth not gratifie them therein; as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they asked it meerly to tempt him, and not out of any real Desire of Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p>Worse than these, by far, were those other Pharisees, who, not content a little to obscure, did malitiously calumniate our Saviour, saying, <hi>That he did cast out devils by</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">How they knew that the name of the chief of the Devils was <hi>Beelzebub,</hi> may be seen in <hi>Just. Mart. Qu. &amp; Resp. ad Orthod. Q.</hi> 82. 2 Kings 1.2.</note>
               <hi>Beelzebub the chief of the devils.</hi> This <hi>Beelzebub</hi> is, by Interpretation, the God of Flies, and was <hi>the god of Ekron,</hi> as we read in the Book of the <hi>Kings. Josephus</hi> calls him <hi>the god-fly,</hi> or <hi>fly-god</hi> of the Ekronites; so called, as some think, because the Devil, in the shape of a great Fly, gave answer to them who enquired of him; others, that he was so called from the abundance of Flies which
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:93582:5"/>followed the Sacrifices offered unto him. Whereas they say, no Flies infested the Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces offered to the true God: and so they take it to be a name of Reproach.<note place="margin">Selden. de Diis Syris, <hi>Syn. 2. c. 5.</hi>
               </note> But I rather think the truth to be with them who dissent from this common opinion, and take the name to be given unto the Idol, by the Ekronites themselves: because upon sacrificing to this Idol the Flies were driven away; of which se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral like Instances are given by the Learned <hi>Selden.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>This being so, no greater Calumny could Malice have devised, than this, That <hi>the Lord Jesus, the Eternal Son of God,</hi> in our nature on the Earth, casting out Devils, should do it by the power of this filthy God, and Prince of the Devils. <hi>No virtue is so illustrious, no action so vertuous, but is subject to slander and calumny, through the malice of men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Unto this wicked slander our Saviour makes his defence, in the words of my Text; shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that could not be which they objected; for then Sathan should be divided against himself, and his Kingdom brought to desolation. <hi>But be, knowing their thoughts, said unto them, Every
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:93582:5"/>kingdom divided against it self is brought to desolation, and a house divided against a house falleth.</hi> Passing by what may be said concerning Apologies from the Context, the lawfulness of them, when, and how they are to be made, we observe two things in the words; <hi>The Omnisciency of Christ,</hi> in those words, <hi>But he knowing their thoughts:</hi> And, <hi>the danger of intestine division,</hi> in those words, <hi>Every kingdom divided against it self is brought to desolation, and an house divided against a house falleth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, concerning the Omnisciency of Christ, <hi>And he knowing their Thoughts.</hi> That Christ is Omniscient, and knoweth all things, even the most secret Thoughts of our Hearts, is a Doctrine often taught us, in the Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures; and of very great Concernment, for us to take special notice of.<note place="margin">John 2.24.25.</note> St. <hi>John,</hi> speaking of several, who believed in Christ, because of the Miracles which he did, expresly saith, <hi>That Jesus did not commit himself unto them, because he knew all men, and needed not that any should testifie of man, for he knew what was in man.</hi> This he could not have done if he had not been Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scient. His knowing <hi>Nathaniel</hi> to be an <hi>Israelite</hi> indeed, and his knowing of him before ever <hi>Philip</hi> called him, when he was under the Fig-tree,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:93582:6"/>did evidence his omnisciency. We find also (besides what is mentioned in the Text) how he doth reprove Men for their thoughts, which they had not spoken: for when he had told the man sick of the Palsie, that his Sins were forgiven him, <hi>and certain of the Scribes said within themselves, this man blasphemeth:</hi> he knew their thoughts, and reproved them for their wicked imaginations,<note place="margin">Matt. 9.2.3.4.</note> saying, <hi>Wherefore think ye evil in your hearts?</hi> By which we see, that <hi>Christ</hi> hears the words of our Hearts, as well as the words of our Mouths. Nor can any thing be plainer to this purpose, than what our Saviour saith of himself,<note place="margin">Rev. 2.23.</note>
               <hi>I am he which searcheth the hearts and reins.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From whence we infer, That <hi>Christ</hi> must needs be God as well as Man: not only a <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Man,</hi> acording to the <hi>Arians, Photinians,</hi> and <hi>Socinians;</hi> but <hi>God-Man.</hi> Here lies the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of our Consolation and Salvation. If he were a mere Man, then could not his Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, active and passive, have been satisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for us; then could not his Blood have had such virtue, as to purchase Heaven for us; then could he not have vanquished <hi>Sathan, Hell,</hi> and <hi>Death;</hi> then were it vain to believe in him: nay, not only in vain, arguing our Weakness,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:93582:6"/>but it would be Sin and Wickedness in us so to do: and hereby should we bring our selves under that Curse, <hi>Cursed be the Man, that trusteth in Man, and maketh flesh his Arm.</hi> This we know, That there is no way to salvation, but by Faith in the Son of God, and therefore he must needs be true God.</p>
            <p>The meditation of this Truth, might also be pressed for the amendment of our Lives. When we perform any holy duties, let us look unto our Hearts, since we have to do with him who knows how our Hearts are affected when we are in his presence. When we are in God's House, praying, hearing, receiving the holy Sacrament, not a wandring Thought can stir within us, but it is altogether known to him.</p>
            <p>And in the whole course of our lives, in all Places, in all Companies, where-ever we are, what-ever we do, let us always remember, that our Hearts are known to <hi>Christ</hi> our Judge. This Meditation will be very proper for you who are concerned in the great Transactions of this Day, to consider that God knows with what Hearts and Intentions you meet together; whether you aim, sincerely, at his Glory.</p>
            <p>After the Omnisciency of <hi>Christ,</hi> our next
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:93582:7"/>Point (and that which we are chiefly to insist upon) is, the Danger of intestine Division, in the following part of the words, <hi>Every king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom divided against it self is brought to desolation, and an house divided against an house falleth.</hi>

Thus it is. Let a Kingdom be never so well provided, if they cannot agree, they

You know what hath been said concerning the quarrel between the rest of the Members and the Stomach, and how the Body must have perished, had they not seen their Folly, and united.

            <p>But alas! though every one will praise Peace and Unity, few there are who do faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully endeavour it: every one hath a tongue to commend it, few have Arms to embrace it, or Feet to walk in the ways of Peace.

            <p>How tardy the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> was in this particular; we read enough and too much, the <hi>Apostle</hi> calls them <hi>babes in Christ;</hi> but the <hi>old man</hi> was too strong in these infant Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans: Mens Persons they had in admiration, one was for <hi>Paul,</hi> another for <hi>Apollos,</hi> a third for <hi>Cephas:</hi> 'tis very likely St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> and the silver-tongu'd <hi>Apollos</hi> too, agreed well enough; these strings were well tun'd by

            <p>For God's sake, Christians, let us have a care: may wee not in this Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> see our own Face as in a Glass? nay, are not our Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions more, our Factions stronger? I am un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to say what is upon publick record; but Our present Divisions, and this present occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on doth make it in some sort necessary for me to mention it: Concerning us it was the sad Complaint of <hi>Gregory</hi> the ninth, not spoken without some pity and compassion towards us, <hi>Oye</hi> English-men, <hi>you are the most miserable men in the World, every one of you bites each other, and studies to impoverish each other.</hi> What doth it profit us, that we live together in one place, if we be not of one mind? God more loves the Unity of Hearts than Place. Why should we give the <hi>Devil</hi> such an advantage against us? or why should we of this Kingdom, of this House, give the common Enemies cause to rejoice, to see us do their work for them, and destroy
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:93582:11"/>one another? Are we not all satisfied in this, That all our unhappy Divisions are begun, promoted and carried on by the <hi>Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks?</hi> why should we then thus divide, and gratifie our mortal Enemies?<note place="margin">Euse. <hi>Eccl.

            <p>Unto what hath been said, I shall add two Arguments, tending to put an end to our Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, and bring us to Unity.</p>
            <p>The first shall be the common Argument so much insisted upon in Scripture taken from your relation to each other; are you not Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, of the same Kingdom, of the same House, professing the same Religion? I beseech you then, <hi>love as Brethren.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I know you profess to be travelling towards Heaven, all tell us they are bound for Heaven, that's the Port they are sailing to, to the land of <hi>Canaan</hi> they are travelling: say you so? hear the Patriarch <hi>Joseph,</hi> let me speak to you, as he to his Brethren, going to the land of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan, see that you fall not out by the way.</hi> Greater
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:93582:12"/>is the Fraternity of <hi>Christ,</hi> than of Blood; he is a true Brother,<note place="margin">S. <hi>Ambr.</hi> Dom. quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quages. Major est frater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitas Christi, quam san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinis; verus frater est, cujus idem spiritus &amp; vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntas est.</note> who hath the same Spirit and Will, as St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> well teacheth. Or if you had rather hear Father <hi>Abraham,</hi> take him for your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample; when there was an unhappy Division and Difference between <hi>Lot</hi>'s Herds<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and his, and this increased so far as to cause a misunderstanding between <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Lot</hi> themselves, observe how he beseecheth, how he argueth, how he pleadeth for an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation, Agreement,<note place="margin">Gen. 13.8.</note> and Unity; <hi>Let there be no strife, I pray thee, between me and thee, between my herdmen and thy herdmen, for we be Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</hi> Brethren they were by Birth, by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, by Profession, Brethren as Men, as Country-Men, as Kinsmen, as Religious Men. See how Father <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Arguments are framed; <hi>Let there, I pray thee, be no strife between me and thee, for we are Brethren,</hi> as Men, Men-Brethren; It is for Beasts to snarle and quarrel, to divide, to contend, not for Men-Brethren so to do; think of it, <hi>Lot,</hi> we are Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, yet in a nearer Capacity, as Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, of the same Nation; why then should there be such a Strife and Division between us?
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:93582:12"/>if there be Divisions where Languages are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, yet 'tis not fit it should be so between us. If this be so, yet consider we are Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, nearer than so, for we are Kinsmen, are we not united by Blood? why then should we be divided by any thing? nay farther, <hi>Lot,</hi> consider, how we have been educated in the same Calling and Occupation? have we not been Brother-Travellers, and Brethren in Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction many a time? let there not then be any Strife between us. I pray thee let it not be, let us find out some expedient that there may be a Composure, and this Contention may be no longer; and if all this seem little unto thee, yet I know, <hi>Lot,</hi> thou art a pious man, one who fearest God, one who hast a Love to the true Religion, and canst not but have a Love to all who are truly religious, thou knowest what our Religion teacheth, <hi>Union not Division; Peace as well as Holiness.</hi> What a hindrance must it needs be, and disparagement to God's true Religion, when the Enemies to Piety who live about us shall see us thus strive and fall out with one another? what will they say? nay, if this be your Religion to do thus, if that teach you to be so contentious with one
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:93582:13"/>another, whatever Religion we are of, we will not be of yours; I pray thee therefore, <hi>Lot,</hi> think of it better, let us not divide, let there be no Strife between us Brethren, professing the same Religion, serving the same God, expecting to enjoy the same Happiness in Heaven. This is the Import of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Speech to <hi>Lot,</hi> these the Arguments he useth to compose the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and put an end to the Strife between them.</p>
            <p>And what remains but that we should put this close to our selves, and like good Children, learn this Lesson of Father <hi>Abraham,</hi> not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, not to divide, but to unite among our selves? Are you not Brethren, as Men, Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren as Countrey-men, Brethren as Fellow-Citizens, Brethren as Christians, Brethren as Protestants, and have you not sometimes been Brethren in Affliction too? Let there not then be any Strife, any Division among you. I know you would be glad to have <hi>Lazarus</hi> his Portion in the other Life, to be in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Bosom; that's a desirable, and most comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table place: the way is to live as <hi>Abraham</hi> did, and walk after his example, and do, what in you lies, to preserve Peace and Union in the World.</p>
            <pb n="21" facs="tcp:93582:13"/>
            <p> Secondly, Consider the sin of Contention and Division. This we will touch in Three Particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Division is a sin which bears a near resemblance unto theirs, who crucified the Lord of Life.<note n="*" place="margin">S. <hi>Ambr.</hi> Dom. in passione, Quid est Christus nisi veritas &amp; pax? ergo qui pro falsitate relinquit veritatem, &amp; pro cupidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate dirumpit charit. item, &amp; odit pacem, nihil aliu<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â¢</desc>
                  </gap> facere videtur quam lapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dare &amp; crucisi pre, &amp; oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidere Christum, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note>
               <hi>What is Christ, but truth and peace? therefore he who leaves the truth for errour, who doth break the bond of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and hate peace, seems to do nothing else but to stone, to crucifie, to slay Christ.</hi> Was not the Soldiers sin great, who were so officious in crucifying Christ? You cannot think otherwise; yet these Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, as bad as they were, would not break the Legs of Christ; and shall we tear the Church of Christ, by our Divisions? So long as his Body hung upon the Cross, among Thieves and Malefactors, it remained whole; and shall Christians rend it and tear it in pieces?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Division is a sin which damps all our Comforts in this World, and renders all our Religious Duties ineffectual. What is it that sweetens all Comfort, and makes all we do acceptable unto God? Is it not Peace and Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? What sowres all, and renders all Duties ineffectual? Is it not Contention and Division?
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:93582:14"/>Certainly it is. Peace is that superlative good without which nothing is good; the Apostle calls it <hi>the bond of peace:</hi> this is it which keeps all our Comforts. Let a Man haveall those things in the World esteemed pretious, Health, Wealth, Wife, Children, Parents, Servants, pleasant Gardens, stately Palaces: if he have all these, but Peace be not there; if he be continually in Strife and Contention, this sowres all, this turns his Gold into Dross, this turns his Wine into Vinegar, this turns his Palaces into Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons, this turns his Orchards and Gardens in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Wilderness, and this turns his Honey into Gall. It is good Agreement, Unity, mutual Love, which doth animate, maintain, and tye Christians together, who, without it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a burden to nature, and to one another: it is like the Fire in the burning Bush; it adds Lustre to them; the more it flames, the more it beautifies: this is it which puts a Grace up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all Religious Duties; but Division and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention venomes all. You hear God's Word preached, as near as you can you omit no op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, you pray often, you give Alms, you receive Sacraments; 'tis well, but if you be troublesome, unpeaceable, if you be dividers
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:93582:14"/>in God's <hi>Israel,</hi> this stains all, pollutes all, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanes all. <hi>If thou bringest thy gift unto the Altar:</hi> You know who said it, and what follows. A de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful thing it is to hear an Instrument well tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, played upon by a skilful hand, where there is a sweet Harmony among all the Strings; but how ungrateful is it, to hear an Instrument struck upon when all the Strings are out of Tune? Thus is it (as <hi>Origen</hi> well notes) where the Body of Christians have Strife,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Orig.</hi> Hom. <hi>26.</hi> in Num.</note> Dissentions, Divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons among them, then all things are ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, nothing is there that God accepts without Charity: pray never so much, hear never so much, if you be strings out of Tune, if for Contention, if addicted to Division, God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of nothing you do; this makes all abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable unto him. Consider then how great a sin this Division is, which doth not only spoil our earthly Comforts, but is the Flye in the Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all holy Duties, corrupting and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them odious unto that God to whom we do perform them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Division will drive God from among us. What made <hi>Israel</hi> so happy, above all other Nations, but because they had the God of Heaven dwelling among them? Herein is the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:93582:15"/>happiness of a Kingdom, of a Church, of a City, of a House; blessed is the People who have God among them. Certainly it is our great concern, to do those things which may keep God with us: it is not every ordinary sin which will drive God from a People, but Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and Contention will do this; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this must needs be a grievous sin. At <hi>Salem</hi> is his Tabernacle, and that's Peace; make him that place, and he will come and take up his rest; but if we be contentious, he will be gone, but <hi>Woe be to us, if God depart from us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We know not what we do, when we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with one another, and divide from one another; if we did, we would rather lay down our lives than break the Unity either of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Politick or Ecclesiastick. To this purpose admirable is the Example of <hi>Gregory Nazian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Greg. <hi>presb. in vit.</hi> Greg. Naz.</note> who, when there was a contention about his being Bishop of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> desired them to cast him into the Sea, as another <hi>Jonas,</hi> that the Tempest might cease.</p>
            <p>To conclude all; If there be any loveliness in Peace and Unity; if we have any respect for Christ and his true Religion; if any love towards our Brethren; if we would have any
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:93582:15"/>duty, we perform, accepted of God; if we would have God abide among us, and not drive him quite away from us; if we have any love to our precious Souls, and care that they should be eternally saved; if the Kingdom, in which we live, and the Church of God have any Interest in our Affections, and are dear unto us, let us study and endeavour all ways for Peace and Unity: let us keep clear from Strife and Division, let us not bite and devour one another, for <hi>Every kingdom divided against it self is brought to desolation, and an house divided against a house, falleth.</hi>
